# Part A – Foundations

## 1. Objects

**Definition:** An object is a program component that contains **data** and performs **operations**. Programs use objects to carry out specific tasks.

Most modern languages (C#, Java, Python, and others) use **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, where a program is built out of objects that work together.

Every object has two things:

| Part | Meaning | Real-life analogy (a car) |
|------|---------|---------------------------|
| **Properties** (also called *fields*) | The data stored in the object | Color, speed, model |
| **Methods** | The operations the object can perform | Start, accelerate, brake |

**Example from the slides – a Wage Calculator form.** The window is a **form object** that contains:

- 2 **Label** objects: "Number of hours worked" and "Hourly pay rate"
- 2 **TextBox** objects: where the user types values
- 2 **Button** objects: "Calculate gross pay" and "Exit"

Each of these is its own object with its own properties (text, size, position, color) and methods.

**Why it matters:** Objects let you build large programs from small, reusable, understandable pieces.

---

## 2. Controls

**Definition:** Objects that are **visible** in a program's graphical user interface (GUI) are called **controls**.

Commonly used controls:

- **Label** – displays text
- **Button** – performs an action when clicked
- **TextBox** – lets the user type input

Controls enhance the functionality of your programs by letting users interact with them.

**Invisible objects:** Not every object in a GUI can be seen. Examples include:

- **Timer** – triggers actions at set time intervals
- **OpenFileDialog** – lets the user browse for a file (the dialog appears only when needed)

> **Remember:** All controls are objects, but not all objects are controls.

---

## 3. Classes

**Definition:** A **class** is code that describes a particular type of object. It is the blueprint; an object is what you build from it.

| Concept | Analogy |
|---------|---------|
| Class | Blueprint of a house |
| Object | An actual house built from that blueprint |

You can create many objects (many buttons, many labels) from a single class (`Button`, `Label`). Each object has its own property values, even though they share the same design.

---

## 4. The .NET Framework

**Definition:** .NET is a large collection of **classes and other code** you can use to create programs for the Windows operating system.

Key points:

- C# is one of the languages supported by .NET (others include Visual Basic and F#).
- Controls such as Button, Label, and TextBox are defined by **specialized classes provided by .NET**.
- You can also **write your own classes** to perform special tasks.

**Why it matters:** You do not have to build a button from scratch. .NET already provides it, so you can focus on your program's logic.

---

## 5. The Program Development Process (overview)

The chapter's topic list includes section 1.2, the program development process. The slides do not cover it in detail, so here is a brief overview of the standard steps:

1. **Understand the problem** – what should the program do?
2. **Design the GUI** – decide which controls are needed and how they are arranged.
3. **Plan the logic** – decide what happens when the user interacts with each control.
4. **Write the code** – implement the plan in C#.
5. **Test and debug** – run the program, find and fix errors.

---

# Part B – Visual Studio

## 6. Visual Studio IDE

**Definition:** Visual Studio is a professional **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**. An IDE combines the tools a developer needs (code editor, visual designer, compiler, debugger) in a single application.

The three main windows you will use:

| Window | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Designer window** | Where you visually design the form by placing controls |
| **Solution Explorer window** | Lists the project and all of its files (nested expandable list) |
| **Properties window** | Shows and edits the properties of the selected object (for example size, start position, tag, text) |

---

## 7. Menu Bar and Standard Toolbar

### Menu bar
Provides menus such as **File, Edit, View, Project, Build, Debug, Team, Format, Tools, Test, Analyze, Window, Help**.

### Standard toolbar
Contains buttons for **frequently used commands**:

| Button | Function |
|--------|----------|
| Left arrow / Right arrow | Navigate backward / forward |
| New Project icon | Create a new project |
| Open folder icon | Open a file |
| Floppy disk | Save |
| Two floppy disks | Save All |
| Undo / Redo arrows | Undo or redo the last action |
| Solution Configuration (Debug) | Choose the build configuration |
| Solution Platform (Any CPU) | Choose the target platform |
| **Start** (play arrow) | Start debugging (run the program) |
| Folder with magnifying glass | Find |

---

## 8. The Toolbox

**Definition:** The Toolbox is a window for **selecting controls** to use in an application.

- Typically appears on the **left side** of Visual Studio.
- Often is in **Auto Hide** mode (shows only as a vertical tab on the edge).
- Divided into sections such as **All Windows Forms** and **Common Controls**.

Common Controls include: Pointer, Button, CheckBox, CheckedListBox, ComboBox, DateTimePicker, Label, LinkLabel, ListBox, ListView, MaskedTextBox, MonthCalendar.

**Auto Hide:** Lets a window display only as a tab on the edge of the environment. Click the **pushpin icon** on the window's title bar to turn Auto Hide on or off. This frees screen space for the Designer.

---

## 9. Tooltips

**Definition:** A tooltip is a small box that pops up when you **hover the mouse pointer** over an item on the toolbar or toolbox.

**Example:** Hovering over the Save All icon shows *"Save All (Ctrl+Shift+S)"*. Tooltips help you learn what each button does and its keyboard shortcut.

---

## 10. Docked and Floating Windows

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Docked** | The window is attached to one of the edges of the Visual Studio environment |
| **Floating** | The window is detached; you can click and drag it anywhere on the screen |

Rules and tips:

- A window **cannot float if it is in Auto Hide mode**.
- **Right-click** the window's title bar and select **Float** or **Dock** to switch between the two.

---

## 11. Projects and Solutions

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Project** | Each Visual Studio application you create is a project. It contains several files, typically `Form1.cs`, `Program.cs`, and others. |
| **Solution** | A container that can hold **one or more** Visual Studio projects. |
| **Files of a project** | The actual code and resources that make the application run. |

**Hierarchy:**

```
Solution (entire container, can have many projects)
 └── Project (one application)
      ├── Form1.cs      (code for the form)
      ├── Program.cs    (start-up code)
      └── ...other files and resources
```

The slides note that each project you create is saved in its own solution.

---

## 12. Naming a Project and Reopening the Designer

### Specifying the project name
You choose the name when creating the project (in the *Configure your new project* window). It has three fields:

- **Project name** – for example, `MyFirstProject`
- **Location** – where the solution folder will be created
- **Solution name** – by default, the same as the project name

### Displaying the Designer
Sometimes when you open an existing project, the form does not appear automatically in the Designer. To show it:

1. **Right-click** `Form1.cs` in the Solution Explorer.
2. Click **View Designer** in the pop-up menu.

(The same menu also has **View Code**, which opens the source code.)

---

# Part C – Forms and Controls

## 13. Forms and the Bounding Box

- When you start a new **Windows Forms App**, an empty form named **Form1** is created automatically.
- Initially the form is **300 pixels wide by 300 pixels high**.
- In the Designer, the form is enclosed by thin dotted lines called the **bounding box**.
- The bounding box has small **sizing handles** (at the corners and midpoints). Drag them to resize the form.

---

## 14. The Properties Window

**Key idea:** The appearance and other characteristics of a GUI object are determined by its **properties**. Properties are settings that control how the object **looks** and **behaves**.

- The Properties window lists all properties of the selected object.
- Each property has two columns: **Left** = property name, **Right** = property value.

| Property | Example Value |
|----------|---------------|
| ShowIcon | True |
| Size | 300, 300 |
| Text | Form1 |

### Changing a property's value

1. Select the object (for example, click the form once).
2. If the Properties window is not visible, go to **View → Properties Window**.
3. Find the property name in the list and change its value.

**Example:** The **Text** property controls the text in the form's title bar. Change it from `Form1` to `My First Program`.

### Alphabetical vs. Categorized
- **Categorized** (default) groups properties by category and is usually easier for finding things.
- **Alphabetical** lists them A–Z.

---

## 15. Adding, Moving, Resizing, and Deleting Controls

### Adding a control
In the Toolbox, select the control (for example, Button), then either:

- **Double-click** the control, or
- **Click and drag** the control onto the form.

### On the form, you can:
- **Resize** the control using its bounding box and sizing handles
- **Move** the control by dragging it
- **Change its properties** in the Properties window

### Deleting a control
Select the control and press the **Delete** key on the keyboard.

---

## 16. Rules for Naming Controls

Controls are identified by their **names in code**. Control names are also called **identifiers**.

**Rules:**

1. The first character must be a **letter** (upper or lower case) or an **underscore** `_`.
2. All other characters can be **letters, digits, or underscores**.
3. The name **cannot contain spaces**.

| Name | Valid? | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| `showDayButton` | Yes | Follows the rules |
| `DisplayTotal` | Yes | Follows the rules |
| `_ScoreLabel` | Yes | Starts with underscore |
| `2ndLabel` | No | Starts with a digit |
| `show day` | No | Contains a space |
| `total-price` | No | Hyphen is not allowed |

### camelCase convention
Since spaces are not allowed, most C# programmers use **camelCase**:

- Begin with **lowercase** letters.
- The first letter of each following word is **uppercase**.

Examples: `showDayButton`, `firstNameTextBox`, `answerLabel`

> **Good practice:** End the name with the control type (`Button`, `Label`, `TextBox`, `PictureBox`) so the name explains itself.

# Part D – Writing C# Code

## 17. Structure of C# Code

C# code is organized in three main ways:

| Element | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Namespace** | A container that holds classes |
| **Class** | A container that holds methods |
| **Method** | A group of one or more programming statements that perform some operation |

They nest like this:

```
Namespace
 └── Class
      └── Method
           └── Statements
```

### Sample of `Form1.cs`

```csharp
namespace hello_world                     // 1. Project's namespace
{
    public partial class Form1 : Form     // 2. Class declaration
    {
        public Form1()                    // 3. A method (the constructor)
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }
    }
}
```

**Line-by-line:**

- `namespace hello_world` – the user-defined namespace named after the project.
- `public partial class Form1 : Form` – declares class `Form1`, which is based on the `Form` class (the colon means "inherits from").
- `public Form1()` – a special method called the **constructor**; it runs when the form is created.
- `InitializeComponent();` – sets up all the controls you placed in the Designer.
- `{ }` – braces mark the beginning and end of each block.
- `;` – a semicolon ends each statement.

---

## 18. Source Code Files

A file that contains program code is called a **source code file**. Each new project automatically creates two:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Program.cs** | Contains the application's **start-up code**, executed when the application runs |
| **Form1.cs** | Contains the code associated with the **Form1** form |

**To open Form1's code:** right-click `Form1.cs` in Solution Explorer → **View Code**.

---

## 19. Event-Driven Programming

GUI applications are **event-driven**: they respond to events that happen while the program is running. The program waits for the user to do something, then reacts.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Event** | A user's action such as a mouse click, key press, or mouse movement |
| **Event handler** | A method that executes when a specific event takes place |

**Creating an event handler:** In the Designer, **double-click** a control (for example, a Button). Visual Studio links it to its **default event handler** and generates code like:

```csharp
private void myButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{

}
```

**Anatomy of the handler:**

| Part | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `private` | Only accessible inside this class |
| `void` | Returns no value |
| `myButton_Click` | Name = control name + underscore + event name |
| `object sender` | The control that raised the event |
| `EventArgs e` | Extra information about the event |

You write your own statements **between the braces**.

---

## 20. Message Boxes

A **message box** (also called a **dialog box**) displays a message in a small window. .NET provides the method `MessageBox.Show`.

```csharp
private void myButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    MessageBox.Show("Thanks for clicking the button!");
}
```

When the user clicks the button, a window pops up with the text.

**Notes:**

- The message is a **string** enclosed in **double quotes**.
- The statement must end with a **semicolon**.

---

## 21. Hello World Application

The classic first program. It has a **Form** and a **Button**, and displays "Hello World" when the button is clicked.

**Steps:**
1. Create the GUI (Form + Button) – section 2.2.
2. Understand the code structure – section 2.3.
3. Write the code for the button – section 2.4.

**Completed code of `Form1.cs`:**

```csharp
namespace hello_world
{
    public partial class Form1 : Form
    {
        public Form1()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }

        private void messageButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            MessageBox.Show("Hello World");
        }
    }
}
```

**What happens when it runs:**
1. The form appears.
2. The program waits.
3. The user clicks `messageButton`.
4. `messageButton_Click` runs.
5. `MessageBox.Show("Hello World")` displays the message.

---

## 22. Label Controls

A **Label** displays text on a form. It can show **unchanging text** (captions) or **program output** (results).

| Property | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Text** | Gets (reads) or sets (changes) the text shown in the label |
| **Name** | Gets or sets the label's name (identifier used in code) |
| **Font** | Sets the font, font style, and font size |
| **BorderStyle** | Displays a border around the label's text |
| **AutoSize** | Controls how the label resizes to fit its text |
| **TextAlign** | Sets where the text is positioned inside the label |

### TextAlign values (3 × 3 grid)

| TopLeft | TopCenter | TopRight |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **MiddleLeft** | **MiddleCenter** | **MiddleRight** |
| **BottomLeft** | **BottomCenter** | **BottomRight** |

Select a value by clicking the **down-arrow** button beside the TextAlign property.

---

## 23. Displaying Output in a Label

To show program output in a label, assign a value to its `Text` property inside an event handler:

```csharp
private void showButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    answerLabel.Text = "Hello World";
}
```

**Important points:**

1. The `=` sign is the **assignment operator**.
2. The item **receiving** the value must be on the **left** of `=`.
3. The `Text` property accepts a **string only**.
4. To **clear** a label, assign an empty string:

```csharp
answerLabel.Text = "";
```

> **Read it as:** "Set answerLabel's Text to Hello World." Data flows **right to left**.

---

## 24. IntelliSense

**Definition:** IntelliSense is a smart **code completion** feature. As you type, it suggests keywords, variables, methods, classes, and properties you might want to use.

**Benefits:**

- Saves typing and reduces spelling mistakes.
- Provides language references at your fingertips.
- Lets you find information and insert language elements directly into your code.

**Example:** Typing `tra` inside a handler shows a drop-down list of matching items (for example, `translationLabel`). Press **Tab** or **Enter** to accept the highlighted suggestion.

> **Tip:** When you type a control name followed by a dot (for example, `answerLabel.`), IntelliSense lists all of its properties and methods.

---

## 25. PictureBox Controls

A **PictureBox** displays a graphic image on a form.

| Property | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Image** | Specifies the image to display |
| **SizeMode** | Specifies how the image is displayed (for example, stretched, centered, zoomed) |
| **Visible** | Determines whether the control is visible **at run time** (`true` or `false`) |

### Creating clickable images
**Double-click** the PictureBox in the Designer to create a `Click` event handler, then add your code to it:

```csharp
private void cardPictureBox_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    MessageBox.Show("You clicked the picture!");
}
```

This lets images behave like buttons.

---

## 26. Sequential Execution

Statements in a method run **in the order they appear**, from top to bottom. The order matters.

### Correct order

```csharp
private void showBackButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    cardBackPictureBox.Visible = true;    // show the back
    cardFacePictureBox.Visible = false;   // hide the face
}
```

Result: the card flips to its back.

### Incorrect logic

```csharp
private void showBackButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    cardBackPictureBox.Visible = false;   // hides the back
    cardFacePictureBox.Visible = false;   // hides the face
}
```

Result: **both pictures are hidden**. The code compiles and runs, but the result is wrong.

> **Logic error:** a mistake in how the statements are arranged or written that makes the program produce incorrect results, even though there is no syntax error.

---

## 27. Comments, Blank Lines, and Indentation

### Comments
Comments are brief notes placed in source code to **explain how parts of the program work**. The compiler **ignores** them.

**Line comment** – one line, starts with `//`:

```csharp
// Make image of the card back visible.
cardBackPictureBox.Visible = true;
```

**Block comment** – multiple lines, between `/*` and `*/`:

```csharp
/*
   This is line one
   This is line two
*/
```

### Blank lines and indentation
Programmers use blank lines and indentation to make code **human-readable**. The compiler does not need them, but people do.

**Hard to read:**

```csharp
namespace Wage_Calculator
{
public partial class Form1 : Form
{
public Form1()
{
InitializeComponent();
}
private void exitButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
// Close the form.
this.Close();
}
}
}
```

**Easy to read:**

```csharp
namespace Wage_Calculator
{
    public partial class Form1 : Form
    {
        public Form1()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }

        private void exitButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // Close the form.
            this.Close();
        }
    }
}
```

Both are **identical to the computer**, but the second is far easier for people to understand.

---

## 28. Closing a Form or Application

### Close the current form

```csharp
this.Close();
```

`this` refers to the current form (the object whose code is running).

### A common practice: an Exit button

```csharp
private void exitButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    this.Close();
}
```

### Close the entire application

```csharp
Application.Exit();
```

| Statement | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| `this.Close();` | Closes the current form (Form1) |
| `Application.Exit();` | Closes the whole application |

### Comparison with other languages (from the slide notes)

| Language / Framework | Close the form | Exit the application |
|----------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **C#** (Windows Forms) | `this.Close();` | `Application.Exit();` |
| **Java** (Swing) | `this.dispose();` | `System.exit(0);` |
| **JavaScript** (browser) | `window.close();` (only works for windows opened by JavaScript) or hide with `style.display = "none"` | – |
| **React** (JSX) | `onClick={() => setShowForm(false)}` | – |

---

## 29. Syntax Errors

**Definition:** A syntax error is a mistake that breaks the rules of the language (for example a misspelled keyword or a missing semicolon).

**How Visual Studio helps:**

- It examines each statement **as you type** and reports errors.
- A syntax error is **underlined with a red jagged line**.
- If you try to run with an error present, Visual Studio shows a window: *"There were build errors. Would you like to continue and run the last successful build?"* with **Yes** and **No** buttons. Choose **No** and fix the error.

**Example:** In `MessageBox.Sho("Hello World");`, the incomplete method name `Sho` is underlined because `Show` was misspelled.

### Types of errors

| Type | When found | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Syntax error** | Before running (compile time) | Missing `;`, misspelled `Show` |
| **Logic error** | After running (wrong result) | Hiding both PictureBoxes |

### Common syntax mistakes

- Missing semicolon `;`
- Missing closing brace `}` or quote `"`
- Wrong capitalization (C# is **case-sensitive**: `Text` is not `text`)
- Misspelled control or method names

## 30. Corrections to Watch For in the Slides

A few lines in the slides contain typing mistakes. Use the corrected versions in your own code:

| Slide text | Correct C# |
|------------|-----------|
| `Application.Exit;` | `Application.Exit();` (needs parentheses) |
| `cardBackPictureBox.Visible = False;` | `... = false;` (C# uses lowercase `true` / `false`) |
| `lnitializeComponent();` | `InitializeComponent();` (capital **I**, not lowercase L) |
| `Form1.c s`, `Program.c s` | `Form1.cs`, `Program.cs` (the extension is `.cs`) |

---
